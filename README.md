# Miracle Quest

This is a web-based Incremental game written in JavaScript, with some additions of JQuery, and a few other useful libraries. The game follows the traditional pillars of an incremental/idle-style game, where you perform simple actions such as clicking on the screen repeatedly to earn currency. After a time, as the game plays itself, including in the player's absence, hence the moniker "idle game".

## Getting Started

Since this game is purely web-based, that means getting started is simple. Clone/fork/download the code and you can simply open the index.html file in your browser. Alternatively, you may bind index.html to the landing page of a local webserver, specifiying a port to use e.g http://localhost:8080.

### Prerequisites

Some basic of Idle/Incremental games would be useful in knowing the typical formulaic pattern of these games - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game. This game takes the existing patterns and adds some extra levels of progression, such as the 'Pantheon', 'Sacrifice' and 'Cosmic Cube' levels each of which have a unique effect on the gameplay.
